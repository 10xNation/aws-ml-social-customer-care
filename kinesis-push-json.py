Utility to call Amazon Kinesis stream using payload from a file that contains line
separated json. This script is used in conjunction with
create-lambda-function.py, which expectes the Kinesis stream to provide the
input on which predictions are made. All json data being pushed to kinesis is
first converted to string to string key value pairs as that is the expected
format by Amazon Machine Learning.

Usage:
    python kinesis-push-json.py data-line-separated-json.txt kinesis_stream_name interval

data-line-separated-json.txt : File that contains line separated json data.
kinesis_stream_name          : Name of the stream to which the data is pushed to.
interval                     : Interval in millis between two calls to kinesis stream.
