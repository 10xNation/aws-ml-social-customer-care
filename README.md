# Smart Social Customer Care

A smart Twitter monitoring service built on Amazon Machine Learning (with Amazon Mechanical Turk), Amazon Kinesis, AWS Lambda, and Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service).

The application will continuously monitor all tweets that mention your company’s Twitter handle, and predict whether or not your customer support team should reach out to the sender — then notify them of the tweet.
